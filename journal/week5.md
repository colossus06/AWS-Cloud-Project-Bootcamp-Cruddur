# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

## Summary

### Environment

* Windows 10 -wsl
* Local

Started this week running the app locally, installing postgress and changing the default user in environment variables to `postgres`.

Verified that dynamodb is running and created my first table:

Dealt with `M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory"`issue and could solve it with the following command:

```bash
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' list-tables.sh
./list-tables.sh
```
Note: *The first line of my `schema-load` running python script was `#!/usr/bin/python3`.*

Now I could change my `.py` files to `.sh`. Now i had only one table.

```bash
aws dynamodb delete-table --endpoint-url=http://localhost:8000\
    --table-name Music
    --output table
```

** steps to reproduce this**

```bash
./setup.sh 
cd ../ddb/
./drop.sh cruddur-messages
./schema-load.sh 
./list-tables.sh
./seed.sh
```
